Ask the user to input value "Enter the Xth value:"
Take in the inputted value and 
Repeat this until the user inputs a 0

Separate the value inputted into the different digits using modulo
While the temporary value is not 0:
    Take the variable modulo 10 and add this to a temporary total
    Take the variable and divide it by 10 to get the next value to add up
Store these temorary total and add them up

If this added up digit is even (modulo is equal to 0)
    Add this to the even numbers total
    Increment the count of even numbers by 1
If this added up digit is even (not modulo 0)
    Add this to the even numbers total
    Increment the count of odd numbers by 1

Take the total of the even numbers and divide it by the even count for the average even
Take the total of the odd numbers and divide it by the odd count for the average odd

Print "Average of input values whose digits sum up to an even number:" 
Print "Average of input values whose digits sum up to an odd number:"
